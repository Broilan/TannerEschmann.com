But as of now, it feels potentially fruitful, and I will continue accordingly.\n\nWhat is it I intend to write about?\n\nAny thoughts, ideas, or findings I feel are worth sharing and the effort it takes to articulate them. I imagine these will often be philosophically or scientifically themed, but my interests are broad. Notably, I would like to use this as an educational tool; while I realize there is a fair chance nobody will read this, simulating the teaching experience ought to have some benefit, I think.\n\nWe will see.\n\n~ T.E"
